# ROS-Path-Execution

##mobile_path_specification
ROS Package
<br>
After putting it in the 'src' directory of the ros catkin project folder (in our case ~/ros/src)
1. Compile - 'catkin_make'
2. Run - 'roslaunch mobile_path_specification remote_path.launch --screen'

After running a path segment, you can see the robot's path by going into this folder and running 'python processPoints.py'

##Python Simulations
Python programs made to test some ideas I had on how to control the robot. 

##ROS Files
Housed old ROS files before I made a new dedicated package. This is not maintained.
